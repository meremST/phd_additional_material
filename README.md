This repository contains the different models used during the design of a life cycle management system (LCMS).
It contains three types of models used during the different stages resulting from the design methodology presented in the thesis.

The rest of the contents is organised as follows:
* "Trustability Evaluation Models" correspond to step 1 of the method and are available [here](https://github.com/meremST/phd_additional_material/tree/main/Trustability%20Evaluation%20Models).
* "Cost Estimation Models" correspond to step 2 of the method and are available [here](https://github.com/meremST/phd_additional_material/tree/main/Cost%20Estimation%20Models).
* "Verification Models" correspond to step 3 of the method and are available [here](https://github.com/meremST/phd_additional_material/tree/main/Verification%20Models).
