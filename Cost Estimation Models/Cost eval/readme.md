# Cost evaluation

The cost evaluation attempt to confirm or refute the previous cost analysis by using the implementation to obtain numerical data to calculate the different function cost.
The scenario and some additional hypothesis allow to determine the number of calls of the different functions in order to calculate.

## Hypothesis

### Actors amount

Determining the number of each transaction imply to use the SoC lifecycle to determine the number of ownership transfers.
Do to this, it is necessary to set a number of actors for each category of the life cycle.
This information is then used to determine the number of batch divisions for each scenario.
The number of actors are estimated [from public data of manufacturer](https://www.ti.com/about-ti/company/ti-at-a-glance.html) and are fixed as follows.

* One customer per IoT product is considered.
* There is one distributor for every 10000 customers.
* There is one OEM/EMS for 10 every distributors.

This distribution seeks to represent a situation that would be credible.
The closer these numbers are to reality, the more reliable the results will be.

### Scenarios

The way in which LCMS systems can be used is highly variable and depends on the product life cycle.
The life cycle of an LCMS component can be represented as follow.

The component is first manufactured, then a set of manufacturers (OEM and EMS) integrate it into products that are then dispensed by a distributor.
The device is then used by a consumer until its end of life.
An alternative exists where the product are rented rather than sold (PSS principle).
In order to compare the two approaches in realistic cases, three scenarios of use of the system are used.

* Scenario 1: The case where customers are the end rights owner.
The customer is then able to transfer his ownership to another user and purchase new configuration of the component by itself.
This is a use-case that offer many possibilities, such as individualized rent of feature, full customization by the product owner and a high traceability.
* Scenario 2: The case where Distributors are the end rights owner.
In this situation, customer buy a product that can't be customized.
The ability to unlock functionalities is only used by the different manufacturers.
The main benefits to use LCMS in this situation is to simplify the exchange beetween IC Manufacturer and the other companies. Simplifying the product offer, improving inventory management while reinforcing traceability.
* Scenario 3: The case where IC Manufacturers retains all rights. 
In this situation, LCMS is only useful during the exchange beetween IC manufacturer and his client.
The LCMS aspect is invisible to all other actors, this type of use allows to limit the quantity of product reference and to propose an "Ã  la carte" system to each customer.
Traceability is no longer possible and other LCMS functionalities are also very limited.


## Function cost

The Smart contract implementation of the two approaches~is made in Solidity.
The blockchain considered for the evaluation is Ethereum.
By simulating the smart contracts, it is possible to determine their gas cost. 
The Ethereum gas is the way used in the blockchain to determine fees associated with the execution of smart-contracts.
Gas cost can in theory varies but in the case of LCMS applications the memory size of the input values is constant so these costs should not vary.
Once the cost in gas of the functions is obtained, it is quick to determine their cost in US dollars:

| Functions               | State-of-the-art | Batch based |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Contract creation       | 23.50            | 84.26       |
| Register device   	    | 3.88             | 19.64       |
| Transfer ownership/batch| 0.84             | 40.45       |
| Upgrade configuration   | 3.18             | 2.68        |

As said before, to determine the number of each transaction SoC lifecycle can be use as well as the number of concerned actor.
To explain how to make this, the case of 1000000 component is taken. In this case, there are 100000 customers, for 10 distributors, 1 OEM/EMS and 1 manufacturer.
For the first scenario, each component is differentiated, so it is the customers who upgrade the configuration.
The other actors only transfer the ownership and the manufacturer is responsible for the registration of the components and the creation of the contract.
In the state-of-the-art case, knowing the number of intermediary actors is not important.
Indeed, each component being already differentiated, it is necessary to make the 3 transfers of ownership, upgrade and registration for each component.
In case of batch system, the manufacturer make only one record for all the components, then divide the batch into as many subsets for the OEM/EMS, which themselves divide their subsets into as many Distributors, which than again divide the batch as many times as there are customers.
Finally the customers perform the upgrade.
For Scenario 2, the distributors retain the rights to the components.
So they are the ones who makes the upgrades on the sets they own and doesn't transfer their rights.
Scneario requires even less differentiation between components.
Here, the manufacturer keeps all the rights.
To better reflect the logic of customization of components, the manufacturer create as many sets as there are distributors and perform an upgrade per set.
The the total costs for 10, 1000 and 10000 components for each scenario and each time for both approaches are presented bellow.
The calculs made to obtain these results are available in the spreadsheet.

![The different cost of scenario for 10, 1000 and 10000 component](eval.png)

Each time the state of the art approach is darker in color than the batch approach.
The bars corresponding to scenario 1 are red, those of scenario 2 are green and those of scenario 3 are blue.
It is important to specify that the scale of the total cost of the functions is logarithmic to limit the too big difference between the values.
Several remarks can be made about these results.
First of all, whatever the scenario, the batch-less system is more efficient for the small 10 component series.
Over a larger number of products the trend is reversed except for the first scenario which corresponds to the worst case.
